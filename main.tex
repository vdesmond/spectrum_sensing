\section{Energy Detection}
\textbf{\large{Aim}}:\\[10pt]
To detect the unknown PU (Primary user) signal based on energy of the
received signal. The Energy detector is optimal to detect the unknown signal
if the noise power is known. In the energy detection, CR users sense the
presence/absence of the PUs based on the energy of the received signals. As
above, the measured signal r(t) is squared and integrated over the observation
interval T. Finally, the output of the integratorâ€™s compared with a threshold k
to decide if a PU is present. Since the energy detection depends only on the
SNR of the received signal, its performance is susceptible to uncertainty in
noise power. If the noise power is uncertain, the energy detector will not be
able to detect the signal reliably as the SNR is less than a certain threshold,
called an SNR wall. In addition, the energy detector can only determine
the presence of the signal but cannot differentiate signal types. \\[10pt]

From Figure \ref{fig:1.1}, we can infer the fact that there is an trade-off/inverse relationship between Pd and Pfa. Since we want Pd value to be high (greater than 0.5), we see that the corresponding Pfa values range from 0.01 to 0.8. After that the detection probability Pd is approximately 1 for SNR = 6 db.\\[8pt]
From Figure \ref{fig:1.2}, we can infer that the relation is between Pd and SNR is linear for a certain range after which Pd saturates for higher values of SNR (for Pfa = 0.5). For lower values of SNR the detection probability is almost 0 and increasing at a constant slope for every dB increase in SNR. Above 5 db the detection probability Pd saturates 1.\\

\section{Matched Filter Detection}
\textbf{\large{Aim}}:\\[10pt]
To detect the unknown PU (Primary user) signal based on Prior knowledge
(bandwidth, operating frequency, modulation type etc) and to maximize the
SNR. When the user has information on the primary user signal, the optimal
detector in stationary Gaussian noise happens to be the matched filter as it
maximizes the reclosed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The palpable advantage
of matched filter lies in its requirement of smaller time for achieving high
processing gain for the reason of coherence and of a prior knowledge of the
basic user signal like the modulation type and order, the shape of the pulse
and the packet format. The performance of the matched filter will be poor if
this information has no accuracy.\\[10pt]

From Figure \ref{fig:2.1} we can infer the fact that there is an trade-off/inverse relationship between Pd and Pfa, similar to Energy Detection. Since we want over Pd value to be high (greater than 0.5), we see that the corresponding Pfa values range from 0.005 to 0.6. After that the detection probability Pd is approximately 1 for SNR = 6 db. For the same value of SNR, Matched Filter detection provides better Pd vs Pfa characteristics when compared to Energy Detection.\\[8pt]

From Figure \ref{fig:2.2}, we can infer that the relation is between Pd and SNR is linear with saturation at a threshold, similar to Energy Detection (for Pfa = 0.5). However, it can be clearly seen that the characteristics of Pd vs SNR for Matched Filter Detection is much better than that of Energy Detection. The detection probability is high even for very low values of SNR. As expected it saturates to maximum probability around 5 dB.\\

\section{Cyclostationary Feature Detection}
\textbf{\large{Aim}}:\\[10pt]
To detect the PU (Primary user) signal exploiting the cyclostationary features
(spreading code, cyclic prefixes etc). Cyclostationary feature detection is
an alternative detection method. Modulated signals are combined with sine
wave carriers, pulse trains, repeating spreading, hopping sequences or cyclic
prefixes which end up in built in periodicity. These modulated for the reason
that their mean and autocorrelation display periodicity feature. Analysis of
the spectral correlation function helps detection of such periodicity feature.
The spectral correlation function can distinguish between noise energy and
modulated signal energy. This arises from the feature of noise as a wide-sense
stationary signal and no correlation. On the other hand, modulated signals
have the feature of being cyclostationary with special correlation in view of
the embedded redundancy of signal periodicity. Therefore, it is possible for a
detector of cyclostationary feature top perform better than the energy detector
for discrimination against noise. This is because of its robustness to uncertainty
seen in noise power. But, there is the computational complexity entailing a
long duration for observation.\\[10pt]

Figures \ref{fig:3.5} and \ref{fig:3.6} show the cross correlation of the received signal with cosine signal and sine+cosine signal respectively. The amplitude of cross-correlated output signal is a measure of how much the received signal resembles the target signal. The correlation peak specifies the location of the target.\\[8pt]

The main inference from figure \ref{fig:3.7} is the presence of decreasing relation between Pd and Pfa, contrary to what was seen in Energy Detection and Matched Filter Detection.For the lower values of Pf up to 0.0001, probability of detection is nearly 1 and after that, detection of PU is less for more probability of false alarm.\\[8pt]

From figure \ref{fig:3.8}, we can infer the presence of a linear increase in the probability of detection Pd for increasing values of SNR. For SNR = 2 dB, probability of detection is increased compared to other methods of detection. Finally, is that the detection probability reaches 1 at SNR = 15 dB.\\

\section{Co-Operative Spectrum Sensing}
\textbf{\large{Aim}}:\\[10pt]
To enhance the sensing performance by exploiting the spatial diversity in
the observations of spatially located CR users. Theoretically, there is greater
accuracy seen in cooperative detection among unlicensed users with the
possibility of uncertainty in a single userâ€™s detection getting minimized.
The features of multipath fading and shadowing effect undermine the performance of primary user detection methods. However, cooperative detection schemes permit mitigation of multipath fading and shadowing effects, thereby improving the detection probability in a heavily shadowed ambience.\\[10pt]

From Figure \ref{fig:4.1} we can infer that for lower values of Pfa, probability of missed detection (Pmd) is almost 1 and as the value of Pfa increases, Pmd value gradually decreases. \\[8pt]
When the number of users in the cognitive radio system is increased from 5 to 10, the performance of missed detection is increased. In simulation results, Pmd value remains 1 for Pfa values close to 1 (~0.99) and later suddenly reaches 0 when Pfa = 1.
